# JIRAfa
*Google Chrome Extension*

JIRAfa is a Google Chrome extension aimed at Atlassian JIRA
project management web application. It serves to augment some
of its visuals as well as add additional functionality that
I have been missing in the otherwise amazing software.

To try it out just open your Google Chrome menu > More Tools >
Extensions > Load unpacked extension and drop in extension
directory of my project.

# Features

Agile Backlog is being compacted so all issue information
is displayed on one line.

A banner with buttons is added to Agile views to add additional
functionality through buttons.

There is a button in backlog to quick jump to a sprint.

There is a button in backlog to quickly filter for epics.

# The code

My aim was also to improve my skills with the latest ECMAScript
using only JavaScript with official support in Google
Chrome.

I wanted to use modules to organize my code through imports
and exports.

I wanted to improve my functional programming in JavaScript
by the use of unary functions and currying.

# The unit tests

You can find my unit tests in the folder named `tests` at
the top level of the project.

I am using Mocha testing framework with Node.js where I added
ECMAScript support through Babel.

To run it just open your terminal and run 'npm install'
to get your node packages and then 'npm test' to run the
unit tests.
